Papi wants a solid ass EA College Football local non-legit Dynasty companion app that uses user input instead of EA server sourced data
The companion app needs to be accessible online via desktop, laptop, mobile, etc.
Features we want to make sure it has are:
- An option to select one of the 130+ teams as the user's favorite team, which will then change the color scheme of the app to match the team's
- An option to add coaches that are participating in the Dynasty being tracked
- A space to add the coaches' names for the previous feature
- An area to track yearly wins & losses (regular & post-season), as well as bowl games, and conference championships for each coach
- Include a summation for each coaches career wins & losses
